# Prisma Next Starter with tRPC

This is the prisma starter I got from [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/typescript/rest-nextjs-api-routes) but with tRPC ingegrated instead of the traditional next API routes for the backend.

It was an attempt by me to try and deepen my knowledge and expertise with using tRPC.
