# Prisma Next Starter with tRPC

This is the prisma starter I got from [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/typescript/rest-nextjs-api-routes) but with tRPC integrated instead of the traditional next API routes for the backend.

It was an attempt by me to try and deepen my knowledge and expertise in tRPC.

I scaffolded the project with the [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction) CLI tool. It's wonderful how it eliminates a lot of overhead for me. Love it
